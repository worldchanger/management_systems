# Architecture Summary & Deployment Plan

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: Architecture Realignment Complete - Ready for Phase 1 Implementation

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The hosting management system architecture has been realigned to match the intended design from `agents.md`. Key clarifications:

- **NO root-level git repository** - only individual app repos exist
- **Local CLI tool only** (no Flask/FastAPI locally)
- **Rails-only** applications on remote (Puma + Nginx)
- **Remote web interface** at hosting.remoteds.us (to be built)
- **Infrastructure as Code** - everything automated and repeatable

## 📋 Current Architecture (Corrected)

### Local Management Tool (Developer Laptop)
- **Location**: `/Users/bpauley/Projects/mangement-systems/hosting-management-system/`
- **Type**: Python 3.12 CLI tool (`manager.py`)
- **Framework**: Click + Fabric/Paramiko
- **Purpose**: Provision servers, deploy apps, manage configs
- **No Web Server**: CLI-only, no local dashboard

### Remote Infrastructure (asterra.remoteds.us)
- **Host**: Ubuntu 25.04 LTS (Digital Ocean)
- **Apps Deployed**:
  - `cigars.remoteds.us` → Cigar Management (Rails 7.2.2 + Puma)
  - `tobacco.remoteds.us` → Tobacco Management (Rails 7.2.2 + Puma)
  - `hosting.remoteds.us` → Management Interface (Rails 7.2.2 + Puma)
- **Web Server**: Nginx (reverse proxy to Puma)
- **App Server**: Puma (running as www-data user)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

### Git Repositories
1. `cigar-management-system` - Rails app for cigar inventory
2. `tobacco-management-system` - Rails app for tobacco storage  
3. `hosting-management-system` - Python CLI + remote Rails interface
4. **NO root workspace git** - workspace is just a container directory

## 🔄 Architecture Drift Corrections Made

### ❌ What Was Wrong
1. Attempted to deploy FastAPI management API on remote server
2. Added unnecessary complexity with JWT authentication for remote API
3. Created circular dependency (management system managing itself)
4. Added FastAPI app type to config.json
5. Mixed local and remote management interfaces

### ✅ What Was Fixed
1. Removed FastAPI deployment from remote server
2. Simplified config.json - removed hosting-management app entry
3. Updated `agents.md` with correct architecture
4. Removed FastAPI-specific code from manager.py
5. Clarified two-interface design:
   - Local: CLI tool (`manager.py`)
   - Remote: Rails web interface (to be built)

## 🎯 Development Workflow (Critical Rules)

###  Testing & Deployment Rules
1. **ALL Rails development** happens locally on your laptop
2. **Local environment MUST match production**:
   - Same Ruby version (3.3+)
   - Same Rails version (7.2.2)
   - Same gem versions
3. **Testing requirements** BEFORE production push:
   - ✅ Full RSpec unit tests MUST pass
   - ✅ Website MUST load locally
   - ✅ Manual verification complete
4. **Deployment flow**:
   ```
   Local Development → Tests Pass → Git Push → Deploy via CLI
   ```
5. **NO production deployments** without passing tests

### Data Preservation Rules
- Redeployments **NEVER erase production data** by default
- Database and uploaded files are preserved
- Only use `--reset-data` flag when explicitly needed
- All operations are idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

## 🚀 Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup (CURRENT PRIORITY)

### Tasks to Complete Now

#### 1. Create Missing Files
- [ ] Create `DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md` in hosting-management-system/
- [ ] Verify `deployment_key` and `deployment_key.pub` exist
- [ ] Create `remote_cli_tools/` directory with scripts:
  - `parse_logs.sh` - Find errors in logs
  - `check_status.sh` - Check all service statuses  
  - `restart_service.sh` - Quick service restart

#### 2. Update manager.py
- [ ] Add `_install_remote_cli_tools()` method to provisioning
- [ ] Add `view_logs` CLI command (stream journalctl)
- [ ] Add `check_status` CLI command (query systemctl)
- [ ] Verify SSH key deployment works correctly
- [ ] Verify www-data ownership is set correctly

#### 3. Test Full Deployment Cycle
- [ ] Document current server state in DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md
- [ ] Run full provision + deploy cycle
- [ ] Verify all apps deploy successfully
- [ ] Test SSH key deployment
- [ ] Test www-data ownership
- [ ] **Destroy server and rebuild** to verify repeatability

#### 4. Update Documentation
- [ ] Rewrite hosting-management-system/README.md
- [ ] Remove all FastAPI/Flask references
- [ ] Document CLI-only architecture
- [ ] Add deployment procedure examples
- [ ] Cross-reference with agents.md

### Success Criteria for Phase 1
✅ Bare Ubuntu server → fully deployed Rails apps (repeatable)  
✅ All steps documented in DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md  
✅ SSH keys deployed and working  
✅ www-data ownership correctly set  
✅ Destroy/rebuild produces identical results  
✅ No manual steps required

## 📝 Phase 2: Local Development Environment

### Tasks
- [ ] Install Ruby 3.3+ locally
- [ ] Install Rails 7.2.2 locally
- [ ] Verify local environment matches production
- [ ] Document local setup process
- [ ] Create test checklist template
- [ ] Add pre-push hooks (optional)

## 🌐 Phase 3: Remote Management Web Interface

### Design Requirements
- **Technology**: Rails 7.2.2 application
- **Location**: `/var/www/hosting` on remote server
- **Domain**: hosting.remoteds.us
- **Features**:
  - Secure login/password authentication
  - Dashboard showing all app statuses
  - Real-time log viewing
  - App control (start/stop/restart)
  - Trigger deployments
  - View configurations
  - API endpoints for programmatic access
  - Backup management

### Implementation
- Create new Rails 7.2.2 app in hosting-management-system repo
- Add to config.json as deployment target
- Deploy via same manager.py tool
- Build authentication system
- Create dashboard views
- Implement API endpoints

## 🧪 Phase 4: Testing & QA

### Tasks
- [ ] Pytest coverage for ALL manager.py Fabric tasks
- [ ] Mock connection tests
- [ ] qa-test-repo deployment smoke tests
- [ ] Full deployment cycle automated tests
- [ ] Data preservation verification tests

## 🔧 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Create DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md** - Document current deployment
2. **Verify SSH keys** - Ensure deployment_key files exist
3. **Create remote CLI tools** - Log parsing and service management
4. **Test provision cycle** - Run full provision on clean server
5. **Destroy and rebuild** - Verify repeatability
6. **Update TODO.md** - Mark Phase 1 tasks

## 📊 Current TODO.md Status

### Issues Found in TODO.md
- Many completed items still reference Flask/FastAPI (obsolete)
- "In Progress" item references old secrets management (complete)
- Missing Phase 1 infrastructure tasks
- No tasks for DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md creation
- No tasks for remote CLI tools

### Recommended TODO.md Updates
**Move to "To Do":**
- Create DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md file
- Verify and document SSH key deployment
- Create remote_cli_tools directory and scripts
- Update manager.py with remote tool installation
- Full provision + deploy cycle test

**Move to "Completed":**
- Test one-click deployment (mark as incomplete due to architecture changes)

**Remove from "Backlog":**
- Fix 404 error for /favicon.ico (no longer relevant - no FastAPI)

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- ✅ Can provision bare Ubuntu server to production-ready state
- ✅ All steps documented in DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md
- ✅ Destroy/rebuild produces identical results
- ✅ No manual intervention required
- ✅ All configuration in code (Infrastructure as Code)

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- ✅ Local Ruby/Rails environment matches production
- ✅ Can develop and test Rails apps locally
- ✅ Test suite running locally
- ✅ Development workflow documented

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- ✅ hosting.remoteds.us serves management interface
- ✅ Can monitor all apps via web dashboard
- ✅ Can control apps via web interface
- ✅ API endpoints functional
- ✅ Secure authentication working

## 📝 Notes

- **Remember**: NO root-level git - only individual app repos
- **Critical**: All provisioning must be scripted and repeatable
- **Testing**: No production deploy without passing local tests
- **Data Safety**: Never erase production data unless explicitly told
- **Documentation**: Update DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md with every change

---

**Next Action**: Create DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md and document current server state before any changes.
